# Security Measures

## Authentication & Authorization

1. **JWT Implementation**
   - Tokens are signed with a strong secret key
   - Short expiration times (15 minutes for access tokens)
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Token blacklisting for logged-out sessions

2. **Password Security**
   - Bcrypt hashing with salt
   - Minimum password requirements:
     - 8 characters minimum
     - At least one uppercase letter
     - At least one lowercase letter
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
   - API endpoints: 100 requests per minute
   - IP-based blocking after multiple violations

## Data Protection

1. **Database Security**
   - Encrypted connections (SSL/TLS)
   - Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Regular security audits
   - Data encryption at rest

2. **API Security**
   - CORS configuration
   - Input validation
   - Request sanitization
   - HTTPS enforcement

3. **Sensitive Data**
   - PII encryption
   - Secure storage of credentials
   - Regular data purging
   - Data access logging

## Infrastructure Security

1. **Docker Security**
   - Non-root user in containers
   - Regular base image updates
   - Resource limits
   - Network isolation

2. **Environment Security**
   - Secure secret management
   - Environment variable protection
   - Regular dependency updates
   - Security scanning in CI/CD

## Monitoring & Logging

1. **Security Monitoring**
   - Failed login attempts
   - Suspicious IP addresses
   - Unusual access patterns
   - System resource usage

2. **Audit Logging**
   - User actions
   - System changes
   - Security events
   - Performance metrics

## Incident Response

1. **Security Breach Protocol**
   - Immediate incident response team activation
   - System isolation if necessary
   - User notification
   - Post-incident analysis

2. **Regular Security Updates**
   - Weekly dependency updates
   - Monthly security reviews
   - Quarterly penetration testing
   - Annual security audit

## Compliance

1. **Data Protection**
   - GDPR compliance
   - Data retention policies
   - User consent management
   - Data portability

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Regular access reviews
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)

## Development Security

1. **Code Security**
   - Regular security code reviews
   - Static code analysis
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Secure coding guidelines

2. **Testing Security**
   - Security-focused unit tests
   - Penetration testing
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Security regression testing
